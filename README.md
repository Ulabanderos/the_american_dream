# The American Dream

Everything is white. There are white curtains on the window, a white desk by the wall and a white spread on the bed. It's so sterile, so untouched. I hate it.

"It's top notch, the best hotel in LA," the new manager exclaimed before making that unpleasant grin. I think that expression is his attempt at seeming human, him trying to be something more than a cog in a giant machine that only exists to suck joy and life to produce shareholder profit. I frown at my glass and gently swirl the whiskey. The irony is, back on the simpler days, I was laser focused at getting where I am today. I gave it everything and I loved it. Not once did it occur to me that I could already have reached peak happiness.

There are eight white pills on my palm, four could be lethal for a small female. I bring the whiskey close enough to smell the familiar aroma and, for a blink of an eye, I'm on a Manhattan rooftop, watching the sunrise with Tom. The seagulls cry and the cacophony of urban noise blends into a static hum as we sit in silence, holding hands in the middle of that magical scene. I still have the ridiculous sweater he was wearing that morning.

There is a neurological reason scents evoke vivid memories. Once the journalist was wearing the same cheap cologne as the guy I was crushing on in high school. I gave a terrible interview, because all those embarrassing moments were resurrected in an unbearable detail. Every time I smell birch, I'm back home, at mom's house and the endless childhood summers spent wandering in the forest and floating toy boats in the stream. When I smell the hand sanitizer, I'm by Tom's bed again. Him too weak to stay awake and horribly gaunt. Me being crushed under an overwhelming weight.

There is a huge TV screen and I hate it.

The whiskey spills everywhere, on the floor, the furniture, the roof, when I throw my glass at the screen. It breaks and the screen splinters, millions of tiny pieces of glass sparkle in the air and I stand amid the destruction. My face is stone, I'm out of tears. To be honest, I'm out of sadness too. In a world where nothing matters anymore, disdain is what I have left. They will apologize for the screen, a generous payment will be made and everything will be forgotten. I'll give the interviews as planned, on coke if I'm not inspiring enough otherwise. I'll go on the stage and tell them that anyone can be like me. Anyone can pursue the American Dream.

I squeeze the pills in my hand.
